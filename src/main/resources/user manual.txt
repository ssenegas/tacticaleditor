         : THE MATCH - JOYSTICK Control

INTRODUCTION
The newly appointed PLAYER MANAGER of a third division club, an
international class player, can use his skill and experience on the pitch
and help his club to be promoted swiftly. Further promotion and success in the
top division will require a balanced team and  winning tactics.

Four well proven tactics are provided and he can refine tactics or design
totally new tactics.The transfer market gives the opportunity to strengthen
his squad. There are over 1000 players in the league. Each player is an
individual with a unique mixture of several attributes and playing skills.

The financial control of the club rests with the board. The manager is kept
informed as to how much money he has available to buy players.If extra money
is required, he must seek the boards permission.The board may also ask him to
sell players in order to help the club's finances.

The actual match uses a refined version of KICK OFF, retaining the controls
and the game play. The match lasts five minutes each half and the manager if
he selects himself can play in the game.He can either control the player
nearest the ball or play in his designated position.Only in his assigned
position will he play as an international class player. In other positions he
will assume the attributes of that player.He can substitute the players and
change tactics when the ball goes out of play. If watching instead of playing
he has the option to watch any one player on the field and study his game play
in depth, an invaluable facility to study a player on the transfer market. He
has the option to watch an accelerated version of the game on the scanner,
still retaining the  options to substitute the change tactics.

The manager can greatly improve his chances of success by paying great
attention to the player info. The player attributes and skills change with
experience and training. A player improves his skills with his playing
position, yet his talents may lie elsewhere. The manager may experiment by
training a player in a different position and perhaps discover a hidden
talent.

The real task of a manager is to understand how events can effect the morale
of an individual,player or the whole team and the measures he must take to
counter the effect. The manager must be aware of his own contribution to the
team as a player. When to hang up his boots finally, is the single most
important decision he will make.

The manager must at all time pay due attention to the individual player morale
and the team morale notified in the coah report. The morale effects the
individual player performance and the team performance.

The MESSAGE screen appearing from time to time is used by the board and
coach to keep the manager informed. It also displays interesting NEWS items
which may or may not have a direct bearing on the managers decisions. He must
at all times pay attention to the messages from the board. His job security
rests with the board.

price independent of the boards valuation.

OFFER-NEW-CONTRACT : A player coming to the end of his contract or
requesting transfer may be offered a new contract. The manager has the option
on duration but not the cost of the new contract. Long contracts are generally
more expensive. The cost of a new contract on a lump sum basis will be

should keep a close watch on the players nearing the end of their contract.
The offer of a new contract should be made early as the player may refuse it.

and store as many tactics as you like. The screen is icon driven. The icons on
the top are instructions operators while the icons on the right are for set
pieces like corner kicks etc. The pitch divided in grids numb. 1 to 12 is also
shown. Highlighting a sector by clicking the left mouse button places the ball
in that sector. The tactics are designed for your team playing left to right
as indicated by the arrow at the bottom. When your team switches sides at
halftime a mirror image of the tactics with the players switched to the
opposite wing is automatically produced by the computer. The tactics  must be
designed with the following rules in mind.
 1. At kick off, the opponents must be outside the circle and each side in
    it's own half.
 2. No more than 6 players of any side excluding the keeper can be inside the
    18 yard box.
 3. No opposing players can be inside the 18 yard box during the goal kick.
 4. When a ball in grid numbers 1 or 5 or 9 no player except the keeper may be
    present in 4, 8 and 12. Similarly if the ball is 4 or 8 or 12, no player
    except the keeper can be positioned in 1,5 and 9.

RAY TRACE is very useful in testing the movement of the players as successive
sectors or set piece icons are highlighted. The manager should make sure that
his players have the pace to get to the required positions and that they're
line of movements have a minimum of crossings.
The best way to learn to design is to load any of the already provided and
experiment with them.

BALL CONTROL
The ball controls have been specially designed for ease of use. In a fast
moving game and under pressure, there is no time to remember the complicated
joystick movements. The action has to be instinctive. You are advised to learn
the controls by using the practise skills option in the main menu.

DRIBBLE BALL - The ball travels in front of the player. The distance it
               travels depends on the speed of the player when he made
                contact with the ball.

                the direction the player is facing.

                and give you total control.

                button pressed and move the joystick in the dirction you wish
                to pass and release the fire button.
                Releasing the fire button when joystick is centred and the
                ball is stationary takes you back into dribble action. The
                player will turn in the joystick direction and start dribbling
                the ball in that direction and if the fire button is pressed
                again, shoot in that direction. The ball will remain
                stationary as long as joystick remains centred.

CHIP BALL     - Reverse the direction of the joystick on making contact with
                the ball.

CORNER KICKS  - There is a choice of 9 corner kicks. A selection panel

                button the computer takes the corner. The arrows on the ball
                show the direction of the ball movement relative to the goal.
                The options allow you to curl the ball in or out. A ball
                kicked at the top will travel along the ground, in the middle
                at half height and at the bottom to the bar height.

PENALTIES     - The angle and the height of the shot are controlled enabling
                the penalty taker to put the ball anywhere in the net.
                There is a bar with a pointer moving rapidly from left to
                right This indicates the horizontal position of the ball. The
                height of the ball is determined by how long the button is
                pressed before the contact with the ball is made. The longer
                the fire button is held down, the higher the ball will travel
                It is therfore possible to overshoot or hit the goalposts &
                bar. As soon as the button is pressed, the pointer in the bar
                freezes giving the keeper as split second chance to gauge the
                direction of the shot and a fighting chance to save.
